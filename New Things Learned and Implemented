1. This mini-project is done in Javascript as I have done before Joining organization.
2. This task includes Normal User login and Authorisation with JWT tokeb.
3. One of the new thing that I have learned and Implemented in this is ,
           Not to store JWT token in Local storage or to send in Headers as before , as I understood by reading and through Videos as it is 
           Prone to XSS attacks.

4. Here, I stored JWT token Cookie , with help of Cookie-parser module . Plus, Cookie is (HTTP-ONLY); which is not (LAX) which is safe against 
    CROSS -SITE FORGERY ATTACKS

5. Speciality of this project is : 
                    (i). User Logs-in; Creates a folder to store tasks. A seperate JWT token for each folder created which is stored in Cookie.
                         So, that Folder is in Active state and Task to be created goes to that folder.
                     (ii). If the user wants to open  a certain folder, user clicks on it and that folder is activated.
                    (iii). To be honest, Did'nt implenment deleting task and other as it is a Normal CRUD -operations which are routine.
